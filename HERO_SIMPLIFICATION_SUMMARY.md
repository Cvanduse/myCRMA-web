## Visual Elements Retained

### ✅ Kept for Visual Appeal:
1. **Mesh Overlay** - Subtle background pattern
2. **Parallax Elements** - 3 floating circles
3. **Connectivity Lines** - Data network effect
4. **Dynamic Text Animation** - Rotating hero titles

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Performance Testing:
- Test page load speed before and after changes
- Monitor CPU usage on mobile devices
- Check animation smoothness on various devices

- Verify floating brands are well-positioned
- Ensure no visual gaps from removed elements
- Test on different screen sizes

### 3. User Experience Testing:
- Gather feedback on visual appeal
- Monitor user engagement metrics
- Test with users who prefer reduced motion

## Future Considerations

### Potential Further Optimizations:
1. **Consider removing connectivity lines** if they're not adding value
2. **Reduce parallax elements** from 3 to 2 if needed
